Your CSS looks well-organized and covers various sections of a webpage. Here are a few suggestions and observations to consider:

### 1. **Consistency in Font Sizes**
   - Make sure that the font sizes are consistent across different sections, or if they’re meant to vary, ensure the changes are intentional.

### 2. **Media Queries**
   - You have some media queries in place, but consider adding more for better responsiveness on various devices, especially tablets.

### 3. **Color Scheme**
   - The use of `#b2744c` as a primary color is consistent. Ensure that all elements using this color are visible and accessible.

### 4. **Hover Effects**
   - You have hover effects on buttons and cards which is great. Ensure these effects are visible and enhance the user experience.

### 5. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure that color contrasts meet accessibility standards. For example, text color over background images can be hard to read if not contrasted enough.

### 6. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Test the scrollbar styles and other custom elements across different browsers to ensure compatibility.

### 7. **Responsive Adjustments**
   - For smaller devices, you might need to adjust padding and margins in addition to height changes.

### 8. **General Optimizations**
   - Combine or minimize CSS files if possible to reduce load times.
   - Consider using CSS variables for colors and common styles to make future adjustments easier.
